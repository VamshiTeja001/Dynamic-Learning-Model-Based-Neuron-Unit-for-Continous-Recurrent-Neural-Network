# Dynamic-Learning-Model-Based-Neuron-Unit-for-Continous-Recurrent-Neural-Network

Designed and implemented a differential equation-based neuron in Verilog, inspired by Neuroevolving Electronic Dynamical Networks by Derek Whitley.
Developed a computational model utilizing floating-point arithmetic, integrating an adder, multiplier, and divider for precise mathematical operations.
Optimized performance with a preloaded sigmoid lookup table, reducing computational latency and improving efficiency.
Enabled hardware acceleration for neuroevolutionary algorithms, facilitating faster processing in FPGA-based or ASIC implementations.
